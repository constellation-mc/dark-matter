/**
 * Have you ever wanted to inject some code into a block, only to find out that neither the block nor its superclasses override the method?
 * <p>
 * Well, that is what this annotation is for. It will inject a dummy method into the block. That way, even if some mod overrides the method itself, your code will still run!
 * <p>
 * Only {@link org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.Inject} is supported. Names must be provided in the intermediary format.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is very hacky and its stability is questionable. There's barely any validation.
 * Also, a lot of things have to go right for this to apply correctly.
